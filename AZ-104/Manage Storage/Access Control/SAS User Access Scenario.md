### 🔍 Scenario:

- You generate a **SAS (Shared Access Signature)**.
    
- That SAS grants:
    
    - **Read and List** access.
        
    - To a **specific IP range** (e.g. `192.168.1.1–192.168.1.255`).
        
- You try to access the blob using that SAS **from within the allowed IP range**.

### ✅ What Happens?

> **If you access the resource using the SAS URL from an allowed IP address, you will get access without being prompted for credentials.**

That’s the magic of SAS:

- **The SAS token _is_ your authentication**.
    
- No need for Azure AD login, no account credentials — **the token proves you have the right**.

### 🧠 What Makes It Work?

For the request to succeed:

1. The **SAS token must be valid** (not expired, matches permissions).
    
2. The **request must originate from an allowed IP** (per `sip` range in the SAS).
    
3. The **resource must still exist** (and not be deleted or moved).
    
4. The **storage account network settings** (firewall/VNet) must not block you.

### 🛑 You’ll Get Denied If:

|Reason|What You’ll See|
|---|---|
|You're outside the IP range|HTTP 403 – IP not allowed|
|Token is expired|HTTP 403 – Signature not valid in the specified time range|
|Token permissions don’t match action|HTTP 403 – AuthorizationFailure|
|Blob is deleted|HTTP 404 – Not Found|

### 📦 TL;DR:

|Access with SAS Token|Prompted for Login?|
|---|---|
|From allowed IP|❌ No — SAS handles auth|
|From wrong IP|✅ Denied (403)|
|Without SAS token|✅ Yes, need Azure credentials|
