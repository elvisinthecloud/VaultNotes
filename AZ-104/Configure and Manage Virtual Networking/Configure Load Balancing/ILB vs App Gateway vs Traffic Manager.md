# 🌐 Azure Load Balancing Deep Dive – ILB vs App Gateway vs Traffic Manager

## 📚 AZ-104 Objective Mapping
**Main Objective:**  
`3 – Configure and manage virtual networking`

**Sub-objective:**  
`3.2 – Configure load balancing`

## 📦 Common Azure Load Balancing Options

| Service | Layer | Use Case | Frontend IP Type | Feature Set |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Internal Load Balancer (ILB)** | L4 (TCP/UDP) | Private traffic inside Azure VNets (e.g. VPN, ExpressRoute, VNet-peering) | Private IP | Simple load balancing, no app awareness |


| **Azure Application Gateway (AppGW)** | L7 (HTTP/S) | HTTP/S traffic with URL-routing, SSL offload, WAF, etc. | Public or **Private IP** | Reverse proxy, SSL termination, path routing |


| **Traffic Manager** | DNS | Global DNS routing across public endpoints | Public IPs only | Geo-routing, failover, weighted DNS decisions |

## 🧠 Key Concepts: Private vs Public Traffic

- If users are coming from:
  - **The internet** → they need a **public IP** to connect.
  - **VPN, ExpressRoute, VNet peering** → they connect over **private IP space** inside Azure.

- **VPN = private IP clients.**  
  These users already sit "inside" your virtual network from Azure’s point of view. You do **not** need a public-facing load balancer.

---

## ✅ When to Use Each Option

### 🟩 **Use Internal Load Balancer (ILB)** when:
- Traffic is **TCP/UDP** (not HTTP-specific).
- Clients are **already inside Azure's private IP space** (e.g. VPN, ExpressRoute, peered VNets).
- You only need round-robin or hash-based L4 balancing.
- No need for TLS termination or path-based routing.

**Example:** Distribute SSH (port 22), RDP (port 3389), or backend service traffic across VMs for VPN users.

---

### 🟨 **Use Azure Application Gateway (AppGW)** when:
- App traffic is **HTTP/S**.
- You want **Layer 7 features**, like:
  - Path-based routing (`/api`, `/images`)
  - **SSL offloading**
  - **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
  - Cookie-based session affinity
- Works for:
  - Internet users (**public AppGW**) OR
  - VPN/internal users (**internal AppGW**) ← ***Important!***

**Important Notes (real world + exam):**
- App Gateway **must be in its own dedicated subnet**.
- Internal AppGW gives a **private frontend IP** usable by VPN/ExpressRoute clients.
- Make sure DNS resolution points clients to AppGW’s private IP.

---

### 🟥 **Use Traffic Manager** when:
- You need **global failover** or **geo-based routing** to public-facing endpoints.
- Common scenarios:
  - Multi-region app deployment
  - Distribute traffic between West US and East US app gateways or front doors
  - Route to an Azure endpoint or on-prem via public IP/DNS

**🚫 NOT for private traffic** — it can’t route to private IPs.

## 🧪 Decision Tree for Load Balancer Selection

```text
1. Is the client external (internet)?
   → Yes → Use Public Load Balancer or Public App Gateway
   → No (VPN, ExpressRoute, etc.) → Continue ↓

2. Is the traffic HTTP(S)?
   → Yes → Use Internal Application Gateway
   → No  → Use Internal Load Balancer

## ✅ Example: VPN Clients Accessing Azure VMs

> “A company has users accessing an application via Point-to-Site and Site-to-Site VPNs. The application is hosted on several Azure virtual machines. You need to distribute traffic evenly.”

- 🟩 Correct answers:
    
    - ✅ Internal Load Balancer → to balance across private IPs
        
    - ✅ Application Gateway (internal) → if it's HTTP/S traffic
        
- 🟥 Incorrect:
    
    - Public Load Balancer → VPN clients don’t need a public IP
        
    - Traffic Manager → can’t route to private IPs
        
    - CDN → irrelevant; used only for public, static content

## 📎 Helpful Gotchas & Notes

- **App Gateway** = Layer 7 (HTTPS-aware), reverse proxy
    
- **ILB** = Layer 4, no URL awareness, cheaper
    
- **Traffic Manager** = DNS only, no real-time health-aware load balancing
    
- Internal options (ILB, AppGW) are required for **private IP traffic**
    
- Always ensure **DNS or host resolution points to private IPs** for internal services
    
- Internal App Gateway **must be in its own subnet**
